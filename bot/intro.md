# intro

## Whats its prefix?

Well after you add it to the guild by default its prefix should be `!!`, here is an example command

```
!!ping // returns pong
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can change the prefix by running `!!setprefix <prefix>`
{% endhint %}

to see all the commands you should run `<prefix>help`
